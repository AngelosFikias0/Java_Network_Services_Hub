üöÄ Java Network Services Hub
============================

üìå Project Overview
-------------------

The **Java Network Services Hub** is a modular networking suite designed to manage multiple network services within a unified system. Built in Java, it features a graphical service launcher and supports four core communication protocols: **HTTP, TCP, UDP, and RMI**.

This project integrates **multi-threading, distributed computing, and database-driven logging**, showcasing expertise in **network programming and software engineering**. Its clean, scalable architecture provides a strong foundation for **enterprise-level networking solutions**.

‚ú® Key Features
--------------

### üéõ Graphical Service Launcher (Java Swing UI)

*   **Intuitive Interface**: Seamless service execution with a modern UI.
    
*   **Multi-threaded Execution**: Ensures efficiency without UI interruption.
    
*   **Real-time Feedback**: Dynamic styling and status updates.
    

### üåê HTTP Server Module

*   **Embedded Server**: Handles GET/POST requests, extendable for RESTful APIs.
    
*   **Lightweight & Scalable**: Efficient request handling with minimal resources.
    

### üîå TCP Communication Module

*   **Reliable Communication**: Uses ServerSocket and Socket for secure data exchange.
    
*   **Multi-client Support**: Optimized threading for concurrent connections.
    

### üì° UDP Communication Module

*   **High-Speed Messaging**: Implements DatagramSocket for low-latency communication.
    
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Ideal for real-time applications.
    
*   **PostgreSQL Logging**: Captures network activity for analysis.
    

### üîó RMI (Remote Method Invocation) Module

*   **Distributed Computing**: Enables remote method execution over a network.
    
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Implements RMI Registry, Remote Interfaces, and client-server communication.
    

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Methodologies
--------------------------------

### Core Technologies

*   **Java**: Primary programming language.
    
*   **Java Sockets**: TCP/UDP networking.
    
*   **Java RMI**: Enables distributed computing.
    
*   **PostgreSQL (JDBC)**: Logs network activity.
    
*   **Java Swing**: Provides an interactive UI.
    

### Advanced Principles

*   **Multi-threading & Concurrency**: Ensures performance without bottlenecks.
    
*   **Java Reflection**: Enables dynamic service execution.
    
*   **Exception Handling & Logging**: Robust error management.
    
*   **Modular Design**: Simplifies future expansion.
    

üîç How It Works
---------------

1.  **Launch the Service Manager**: Access all network services through the Swing UI.
    
2.  **Select & Start a Service**: Choose HTTP, TCP, UDP, or RMI, each running in a dedicated thread.
    
3.  **Monitor & Interact**: Connect clients via external tools or built-in handlers.
    
4.  **Analyze Network Activity**: PostgreSQL logs provide insights.
    

üë®‚Äçüíª My Role & Contributions
-----------------------------

*   **Designed and developed** the modular networking hub.
    
*   **Engineered a multi-threaded system** for scalability and performance.
    
*   **Implemented an interactive UI** for seamless service management.
    
*   **Integrated PostgreSQL** for real-time logging and analytics.
    
*   **Optimized reliability and performance** through advanced concurrency control and error handling.
    

üöÄ Future Enhancements
----------------------

*   **Enhance HTTP Server**: Add REST API support.
    
*   **Integrate TLS/SSL Encryption**: Secure communication.
    
*   **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**: Live insights into performance.
    
*   **Containerized Deployment**: Enable scalability with Docker and Kubernetes.
    
*   **Extend RMI Capabilities**: Optimize for microservices and distributed architectures.
    

üåü Why This Project Matters
---------------------------

The **Java Network Services Hub** demonstrates expertise in **software architecture, networking, and system design**. By integrating **high-performance computing, distributed systems, and interactive UI development**, it provides a **scalable and practical solution** for enterprise networking tools, system administration applications, and cloud-based service management.

üèÉ How to Run
-------------

### Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK 17+)** installed
    
*   **PostgreSQL database** (for logging, optional but recommended)
    

### Steps to Run

1.  git clone https://github.com/AngelosFikias0/Java\_Network\_Services\_Hub.gitcd Java\_Network\_Services\_Hub
    
2.  javac -d bin -cp src src/com/networkhub/Main.java
    
3.  java -cp bin com.networkhub.Main
    
4.  **Start a Network Service**
    
    *   Open the **Graphical Service Launcher (Swing UI)**.
        
    *   Select a service (HTTP, TCP, UDP, RMI) and start it.
        
    *   Use external tools or client applications to interact with the running service.
        
5.  **(Optional) Setup PostgreSQL Logging**
    
    *   Update the config.properties file with database credentials.
        
    *   Ensure PostgreSQL is running and tables are created.
        
    *   The application will log network events automatically.
